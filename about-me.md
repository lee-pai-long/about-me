# Lee Pai Long 

Hello, World! I'm Lee Pai Long.<br>
A python developer that currently try to learn frontend black magic.<br>
Some time ago, I chose IT as my Kung-fu.<br>
I try to achieve skills and knowledge through patience, hard work and practice.

> Be like water making its way through cracks. 
> Do not be assertive,

> If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.
> Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water.
> If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup.
> You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle.
> You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
> Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.
- Bruce Lee
